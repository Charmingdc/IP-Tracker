## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Geopify](https://geo.pify.org/) - Ip tracker api
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) - JS library


### What I learned

This project introduce me to leaflet.js, a javascript library for displaying user location on a map. I learnt how to work with leaflet.js and also adding my own custom styling.

### Continued development

I want to take on javaecript projects that doesnt require the use of an api, because most of my projects are api based.

### Useful resources

- [Geopify documentation](https://geo.ipify.org/doc) - This helped me to know how to work with geopify api and its various endpoints.
- [LeafletJs documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html) - This is an amazing doc which introduced me to leaflet.js and how to make use of it.

I have to acknowledge Swag Azreal (Coderblip) for helping me out on changing the location on the map whenever a new ip address or domain is entered as a query.
